Take an array with n elements with possibly duplicate elements as the input. The task is to find the index of the first occurrences of the element x in the array and, if it is not present, return -1.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N representing the size of the array.

The next line contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

The last line contains an integer 'x' whose index has to be found.
Output Format:
The only line of the output prints the Index or -1.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
1 <= x < N
Sample Input 1 :
8
7 5 2 11 2 43 1 1
2
Sample Output 1 :
2
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
2 is present twice in the input array and the first time it appears is at index 2.
Sample Input 2 :
8
7 5 2 11 2 43 1 1
10
Sample Output 2 :
-1
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
10 is not present in the array so the output is -1.




#Your code goes here.
n=int(input())
li=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
num=int(input())
for i in range (n):
    if li[i]==num:
        print(i)
        break
else:
        print(-1)
